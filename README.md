Assignment-02: Who is the Celebrity/Player/Scientist/Nobel Laureates/etc. Android Application!

Who is the Celebrity/Player is an entertainment app that can increase one’s knowledge of Celebrity/Player/Country Map/ etc. In this assignment, your app will implement all necessary UI’s and the app logic. You may create one or more activities for this app. There can be a welcome screen, you can implement a congratulations dialogue once a player correctly identifies 5 consecutive images. If a selection is wrong, you may use a Toast message/change button-color (flush) / use image to highlight and educate the player with the right answer. You may also have an about screen as a menu item, where you will briefly describe yourself. Again, to help new users you may have help menu where you can explain how to play with your app.
